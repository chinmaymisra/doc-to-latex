HOW TO USE:-

1)Go to "dist" folder.

2)Click on "converter.exe".

3)Click on "Select Folder" button.

4)Select the folder where you have stored all the docx files which need conversion.

5)Hit "Convert".

6)Watch magic happen :)


NOTE:- 	There is a specific format for the input docx files,
	a template and some examples have been added in the "Examples" folder.
	You can try out with those first to ensure the script is working.
	Please create further docx files according the template format.


WORKING:-
-->Output will be generated in the same folder which contains docx files.

-->Whenever the converter faces any issue while extracting any latex equation the question is skipped. In such a case
	along with the excel output, an error file is created containing the question numbers 
	which were omitted and the source latex file is generated as well to copy the latex manually.

	KNOWN ISSUES:-
		-While processing matrices.
		(Pls note that these are not all the issues and there may be more issues.)
	
	 output file names:-
		excel:- "<collegename>_<subjectname>.xlsx"
		error csv:- "errors_<collegename>_<subjectname>.csv"
		source latex:- "<collegename>_<subjectname>.tex"
